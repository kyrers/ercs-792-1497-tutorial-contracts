# ERC792 and ERC1497 Tutorial

Tutorial for ERC792 and ERC1497 usage.
All credit goes to Kleros as the contracts are based on the [Kleros tutorial that can be found here](https://developer.kleros.io/en/latest/index.html).
However, the contracts have been slightly modified to use the latest version of solidity available at the time, so the author names have been removed to make it clear nobody from Kleros wrote any code in this project.
